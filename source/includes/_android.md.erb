# Android SDK

## Installation

### Manual
```groovy
// build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar', '*.aar'])
}
```

The Ada Android SDK can be installed manually from the `.aar` file. To get a download link please reach out to an Ada Bot Specialist.

To install the library you need to save the `.aar` file under your app module `libs` folder, for example `MyAwesomeProject/app/libs`, and include `*.aar` in application level `build.gradle` file.

After that synchronize project.

You can also import a file using the Android Studio functionality. To do this, go to `File`->`New`->`New module`. In the appeared window select `Import .JAR/.AAR Package` and click `Next`. After that, specify path to the `.aar` file and the module name, and click `Finish`. 

```groovy
implementation project(':new_module_name')
```

Finally, add this line to your app `build.gradle` file:

### Gradle
```groovy
// build.gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://adasupport.bintray.com/Android-SDK"
        }
    }
}        
```

The Ada Android SDK can be installed using Gradle from the Ada Support Bintray repository.

To integrate the SDK, first add the following code to the project level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
//  if your project has artifacts within the androidx namespace
implementation 'support.ada.embed:android-sdk-appcompat:1.1.2'

//  if your project uses Android Support Library
implementation 'support.ada.embed:android-sdk-appcompat-legacy:1.1.2'
```

Next, add the dependency to the application level `build.gradle`:
